    "The module *LCD* has many different algorithms implemented, and all of them share the same aim; to compute the basins of attraction of a complex rational map. If you are unfamiliar with the theory of iteration of rational maps, or with complex dynamics, this is how some cool-looking fractals like Julia sets are obtained! These basins of attraction are also a very rich and interesting mathematical objects to study. In particular, given a rational map, *LCD* computes the basin of attraction of every *n*-cycle that appears when such rational map is iterated; that is, fixed points (*1*-cycles), *2*-cycles, etc... This is a nice way of visualizing the Julia and Fatou sets associated with the rational map, and provides more information about the basins of attraction than other traditional algorithms. Also, unlike more traditional algorithms, *LCD* does not need to compute the list of fixed points of the rational map (or to have any previous knowledge of the fixed points) before computing the basins of attraction. In addition, *LCD* algorithms are implemented in a way that avoids many computational problems that often appear in numerical analysis, such as mathematical indeterminations or overflows.\n",

    "These methods make up the basic functionality of *LCD*. However, there are a couple more, a bit more technical, but very interesting.\n",
    "These methods are specifically designed to study which cubic polynomials present attracting *n*-cycles in their dynamical behaviour under the iteration of complex Newton-Raphson's method. If you are interested, we recommend you to check out the *Mathematical Framework of LCD*, but roughly speaking, a one-parameter plane is constructed in a way that every point alpha corresponds to the polynomial (z-alpha)(z^2+1). Since we can fix two of the roots of any cubic polynomial to i and -i via a Möbius transformation, studying the dynamical behaviour of this family of polynomials is sort of \"dynamically equivalent\" to studying every cubic polynomial. The following method plots this parameter plane, and colors each point based on if its corresponding polynomial present some kind of *n*-cyclic behaviour. In particular, 4 different colors can be associated with given point alpha; 3 of them in case the arithmetic mean of the 3 roots of the corresponding polynomial converges to one of the roots under iteration of Newton's method, and another color in case this alpha/3 point diverges or converges to an attracting *n*-cycle. This specific criteria for the coloring of the points is a consequence of Fatou's Theorem.\n",

This Lyapunov constants provide us extremely useful information, not only about whether the end point of each basin of attraction is super-attracting, attracting, indiferent or repulsive, but also about how much attractive it is. Lyapunov constants between 0.0 and 1.0 correspond to attracting end points, and the lower the constant is, the more attractive the basins of attraction will be.\n",
    "So, with that in mind, this last algoritms plots the said parameter plane, and colors it based on the value of the Lyapunov constant associated with the orbit of the arithmetic mean of the 3 roots of the corresponding polynomial of each point in the plane. If the constant is 0.0 (super-attracting) one color is assigned, if it is between 0.0 and 1.0 another different color is assigned, and so on for 1.0 (indiferent) and constant values greater than 1.0 (repulsive). This way, the parameter plane provides information not only about which polynomials present *n*-cyclic dynamical behaviour, but also about how fast does the arithmetic root of its 3 roots converges, either to a root or to an attracting *n*-cycle, under iteration of Newton's method."
